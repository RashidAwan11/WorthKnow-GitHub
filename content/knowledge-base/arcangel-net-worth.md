## **Introduction Arcangel:**

Austin Agustín Santos (born December 23, 1985), better known by his stage name Arcángel, is an American singer and rapper. He was born in New York City to Dominican parents. He and his family moved to Puerto Rico and after turning 12, he began moving back and forth between New York City and Puerto Rico.

## **How old is Arcangel?**

Arcangel was born on December 23, 1985 and he is 36 years old.

## **Arcangel Personal life/Biography:**

Arcangel was born in New York City to Dominican parents. He grew up in Villa Palmeras, Santurce, Puerto Rico. His mother, Carmen Rosa, was a member of the merengue group for all women, Las Chicas del Can, who were famous during the 1980's and early 1990's. Arcangel grew up listening to a variety of music and became a fan of rock music.

Most notably Robi Draco Rosa, a Puerto Rican rock musician and former member of Menudo. Arcángel was not always a fan of reggaeton; he says it's not the kind of music he likes, but it's easy to sing. In the early 2000's, Arcángel grew up with a love for new music. Listening to artists such as Tego Calderón and Tempo, motivated him to pursue a career in singing and rape in Puerto Rico.

## **Arcangel Professional Career:**

After returning to Puerto Rico in 2002, Arcángel had decided to follow in the footsteps of reggaeton music. He went on to become part of the reggaeton underground game, Arcángel and De La Ghetto. The two have signed a recording label for Zion reggaeton artist, Baby Records, a company owned by Universal Music Group.

The duo also became involved in Machete Music in 2004 when they recorded albums featuring reggaeton. Arcángel and De La Ghetto became famous in 2006 in a reggaeton song sung by Héctor "El Father", Sangre Nueva, for their hit song, "Ven y Pegate". They were also featured in a compilation hosted by Luny Tunes Mas Flow: Los Benjamins in 2006. 

Although they are an active music duo, Arcángel and De La Ghetto have not released a studio album since the duo was formed. Any production they were involved in only caused the tracks and recordings to be included in the albums that were integrated or leaked online. This was due to a dispute with Baby Records as the company did not release the essentials of Arcángel and De La Ghetto on their own album.

Arcángel said he even spent $ 150,000 on album production, which resulted in the label not being released for marketing. The songs produced are said to have been leaked online instead. Arcángel then sued Baby Records in 2007 for US $ 1,000,000 and eventually left the recording company in December 2006, when he announced that he was starting his own career and setting up his own label.
