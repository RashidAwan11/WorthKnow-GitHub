## **Chad Wheeler Personal life/Biography:**

On December 19, 2015, Wheeler was involved in an incident at a USC facility. Los Angeles police responded to a call at 8:45 AM to a South Los Angeles apartment near the USC campus. Police arrived and a suspect named Wheeler confronted a police officer who allegedly took an assault rifle which led to police shooting him with a bunch of bean bags, a type of less-deadly force. Wheeler was detained by the police but not arrested, and instead was taken to a local hospital to be kept in a secure cell for a psychiatric examination. As a result of the incident, Wheeler missed the Holiday Bowl. Wheeler later apologised for the incident.

On January 23, 2021, Wheeler was arrested in Kent, Washington, on charges of domestic violence. He was charged with three counts of domestic violence and later released on $ 400,000 bail. Wheeler said he would retire temporarily to "cover his life" after the incident. He pleaded not guilty to the charges on February 1, 2021.
