## Chris Perez Professional Career:

Pérez learned to play the French horn in middle school and joined his school concert band with the support of his mother. He decided to teach herself to play the electric guitar despite his mother's disapproval of negative rock-and-roll ideas. Pérez's favourite artists were Van Halen, Mötley Crüe, Def Leppard, Kiss, the Scorpions, Ozzy Osbourne and the Iron Maiden. He also fell in love with Ricky Martin in the 1990s. Most of his guitar songs are inspired by Carlos Santana.

Pérez wanted to flee to Los Angeles, California to start a rock band when he was 17 years old. At the time, she lived in an apartment with her father and worked in the library. Pérez was asked by Tony Lares to join his cousin Shelly Lares' band in 1986. Lares told Pérez that Shelly produced Tejano music, a mixture of traditional Mexican folk, polka, and country music sung in Spanish or English. Pérez disliked Tejano's music and wrote in To Selena, With Love that he joined Shelly's band "which can withstand dragging its feet" because the work was more expensive than working in the library. She became Shelly's music director after Tony left the band, and wrote three songs for Shelly's debut album in 1989. His guitar playing was well received by the band and its fans. This time he also formed a rock band with two of his friends and planned to leave the band Shelly.
