## **David Grutman achievements:**

David Grutman is a globally renowned innovator and entrepreneur in the hospitality field. In particular, he is known for creating immersive experiential venues with distinct atmospheres, infusing high energy and transportive luxury across a one-of-a-kind portfolio of restaurants, hotels, bars, and nightclubs.

Grutman—himself a native Floridian—has built his name in the Miami area, where his firm, Groot Hospitality, owns the restaurants Komodo, Swan, Bar Bevy, OTL, Papi Steak, Strawberry Moon, and Sushi Fly Chicken; the nightclubs LIV at Fontainebleau and Story; and The Goodtime Hotel. Future openings include the restaurant The Key Club, in Miami’s Coconut Grove, and the resort Somewhere Else, on Atlantis Paradise Island in The Bahamas.

These sites are individually influential, yet it’s their combined contribution to the region’s overall hospitality roster that places them on the leading edge: Miami and Miami Beach have long been known for their extensive food, beverage, and hotel offerings, but Grutman has helped to usher in a new paradigm.

He has reestablished the Miami area as a contemporary hotspot by imagining dining, hospitality and nightlife through a lens of lavish design, in-demand talent, a frisson of celebrity, social media moments, and, most importantly, escapist fun. Recognizing the global appeal of this formula, Grutman will soon expand his vision, with anticipated openings ranging across North America, the Middle East and the Caribbean.

In 2008, Grutman opened the nightclub LIV at Fontainebleau after garnering wide acclaim for his prior work in founding the Miami Marketing Group (which specialised in seamlessly merging the fields of nightlife and entertainment). The Fontainebleau had just undergone an extensive renovation by the Soffer family, and it needed an anchor after-hours attraction.

Immediately, LIV garnered worldwide buzz and a celebrity clientele, which it has continued to sustain over the past decade. LIV is especially beloved for its Sunday night party, which attracts world-famous athletes celebrating their championship wins, musicians’ release parties, and movie stars whenever they’re in town. The 18,000 square foot venue is one of the highest grossing nightclubs in the United States.
