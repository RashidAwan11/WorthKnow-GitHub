## Greg Locke Personal life/Biography:

Our attempts to find out more about his family were unsuccessful as such information was not publicly available. Therefore, the identity of Locke's parents is still unclear. It is not known whether he has any siblings. We will review this section when this information becomes available.

Greg married Taisha Locke, his church assistant. They have been together since August 2020. His breakup with his first wife was one of his most controversial moments as he cheated on her with Taisha (Tai Cowan McGee) and said in an interview that his first wife was mentally ill.

He was very upset with her speech but did not say anything about marriage. Prior to that, he had married Melissa. His relationship with Melissa was always stony but ended late when he "swapped" with his church assistant.

Melissa and the pastor have been married for over 21 years and have 3 sons and a daughter together. Both his wives were part of his gospel and his church. In fact, his first wife was a staunch supporter of the Christian faith and often sent a number of trustworthy messages to support their congregation.

Even his second wife is a staunch supporter of their religious beliefs and has many followers online about their purpose and God’s message. Some of the zealous clergy have called Locke an “Adulterer in God’s Eyes”.
