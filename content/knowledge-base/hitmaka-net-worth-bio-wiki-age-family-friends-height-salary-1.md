So now we’re in Trick Trick's club. I came to find out the same club that I didn’t wanna go to and perform. Now, I’m in the club. I’m like 5’6, 150 pounds. I come out there and the whole club security surrounds me.

They whooped my ass through the club, the security. My entourage was all around us and they were getting their asses whooped too!" On October 5, 2010, United Kingdom rapper Rowdy T announced that he had taken Ward's "Batman chain" and called him a snitch for reporting it to police.
