## John Holmes Personal life/Biography:

John Holmes was born John Curtis Estes, in the small town of Ashville, Ohio, about 12 miles south of Columbus. He was the last of four children born to 26-year-old Mary June (née Barton) Holmes, but her father's name, Carl Estes' railway worker, was left blank on her birth certificate. Mary was married to Edgar Harvey Holmes, the father of her three oldest children Dale, Edward and Anne. He and Edgar were married and divorced three times, as are the marriage certificates dated April 13, 1936, August 13, 1945, and September 12, 1947. At the time of their first marriage in 1936, Edgar was 35 years old. aged and divorced, and Mary was 17. After their third and final divorce, Edgar and Mary remarried.

Mary changed John's surname from Estes to Holmes at a young age. In 1986, when Holmes applied for a passport for the first time before his trip to Italy, his mother reportedly gave him a handwritten copy of his first birth certificate, which led Holmes to learn that his biological father was Carl Estes.

Holmes' mother is said to have been a devout Baptist and her children regularly attended church in Millport, Ohio. In contrast, Edgar's stepfather was an alcoholic who came home drunk, stumbled upon a house, and even cleaned up children. As a child, Holmes enjoyed relief from his troubled home life when he visited his maternal grandparents, John W. and Bessie (née Gillenwater) Barton. Mary divorced Edgar when Holmes was a child and moved with her children to Columbus, where they lived in a small apartment with a friend Mary and her two children. The two women work as clerks and waitresses to support their children.

When Holmes was seven, his mother married Harold Bowman on December 31, 1951. Shortly thereafter, Holmes and his family moved from Columbus to the small town of Pataskala, about ten miles \[17 km] east. Holmes recalled that Bowman was a good father until his younger brother David was born, at which point Bowman reportedly lost interest in his adopted children and began to neglect them.

Holmes left home at age 15 and enlisted in the United States Army, with his mother's written permission. He spent most of the three years of his military service in West Germany at the Signal Corps. On his distinguished release in 1963, Holmes moved to Los Angeles, California, where he worked in a variety of jobs, including selling goods from house to house and repairing the Vat Nips factory vat. While an ambulance driver, Holmes met a nurse named Sharon Gebeni in December 1964. They were married on August 21, 1965, in Fort Ord, California, after Holmes was 21 years old.

In April 1965, Holmes got a job as a forklift driver in a warehouse near Cudahy. However, frequent exposure to cold air in a large refrigerator after the outside inhaled hot desert air caused him serious health problems, leading to pneumothorax of his right lung three times during the two years he was working there. Sharon also had health problems, as in between. and in the seventeen months of her marriage to Holmes, she had three different miscarriages.

## John Holmes Professional Career:

In 1971, Holmes' career began with a series of adult films co-produced by an independent detective named Johnny Wadd, written and directed by Bob Chinn. The success of the film Johnny Wadd created an urgent need for follow-up, so Chinn followed suit that year with Flesh of the Lotus. Most of Johnny Wadd 's next films were written and directed by Chinn and produced by Los Angeles-based company Freeway Films.

With the success of Deep Throat (1972), Behind the Green Door (1972) and the Devil in Miss Jones (1973), pornography became chic even though its legitimacy was still debated. Holmes was arrested at this time on a charge of robbery and disorderly conduct, but he avoided prison time by making a name for himself as a spy for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Holmes' "holder" during his time as a reporter was LAPD deputy investigator Thomas Blake. Regarding his involvement with Holmes, Blake said, "It has been a pleasure to work for him." 

In the late 1970's, Holmes was known to earn up to $ 3,000 a day as a sex actor. By this time, his use of cocaine and freebasing had become a major problem. Professionally, it affected her ability to maintain an erection, as evidenced by her obscure performance in Insatiable (1980). In order to support himself and his drug addiction, Holmes became involved in crime, selling drugs to gangs, prostituting himself and men and women, as well as credit card fraud and various forms of petty theft. In 1976, Holmes met 15-year-old Dawn Schiller, who trained and abused him. After coveting money, Holmes forced Schiller to become a prostitute and often beat him, which he did at least once in public.
