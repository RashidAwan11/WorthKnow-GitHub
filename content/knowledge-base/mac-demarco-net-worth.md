## **Mac Demarco Facts:**

* Mac DeMarco was born Vernor Winfield MacBriare Smith IV, on April 30, 1990, in Duncan, British Columbia. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Edmonton, Alberta, where Mac spent the rest of his adolescence. When he was 5 years old, his father left home. He rarely met Mac.
* He had a family with strong roots in music. His grandmother was a popular opera singer, while his grandfather was a saxophone player. His mother and his aunt had also been interested in music briefly in their younger days. Hence, Mac was highly influenced by music while growing up.
* However, Mac resisted the urge to become a musician for a long time. He liked music but never aspired to become a musician until he was a teenager. When he started playing music in school, it was mostly just to impress girls. He later became a little more serious about music and joined a few bands in high school.
* He first became part of an amateur school band named ‘Meat Cleavers,’ which was, according to Mac, a “jock-rock band.” He then joined another band, ‘Sound of Love,’ which focused on R&B music. Again, the members were amateur and played music just to become popular with the girls in school. Mac then continued to join a few more independent bands but none of them suited him.
* Mac then decided to make music independently and began releasing his own music as part of his project, ‘Makeout Videotape.’ Most of the music he made did not become popular. In 2008, Mac graduated high school and moved to Vancouver to concentrate more on his music.
