3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album titled Same Game, Different Rules. The album and its one-hit single "Uh Oh" have been released on the label, feeling like it doesn't have enough urban radio appeal. Tracks from the same game, Different Rules are streamed online in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the band.

In August 2002, the band was about to release their new LP, A Girl Can Mack, when Naughton announced she was no longer a member of the band. Naughton claims that two other girls and their bosses forced her out. The problems came to a head after a heated argument with Williams, Bailon and their manager, who allegedly led Williams to throw a hot plate full of KFC food in Naughton.

Epic Records then terminated their relationship with both 3LW and Naughton. In addition to Naughton's departure both Bailon and Williams resumed as a team for a short time and later Jessica Benson replaced Naughton. The group has disbanded. In May 2017, he reunited with his co-worker Bailon in the afternoon interview with The Real, who promoted the first game of the Power season.
