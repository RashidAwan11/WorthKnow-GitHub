The game is based on Rinella's hunting activities in places like Montana (deer, elk); Alaska (waterfowl, mountain goat, Dall sheep, caribou, black bear, moose); Mexico (wild turkey, buffalo); New Zealand (tahr, chamois, red stag); Arizona (mountain lion, Coues deer); Wisconsin (white-tailed deer, rabbit, beaver, muskrat); and California (wild boar, quail, and turkey.)

The exhibition provides hunting protection and creates the impression that hunters have a responsibility to be country officials and protectors of their favourite species. \[4] The episodes include interesting and sometimes artistic food arrangements after the hunt. Examples include deer heart wrapped in hot oil and roasted on the fire, javelina meat boiled inside the animal's stomach, and regular preparations. The series premiered on January 1, 2012, and has just completed its tenth season.
