## **FTC Disclosure Compliance Rules**

In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission released their new rules for Disclosure Compliance.

These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media are aware if the blogger or publisher is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered with a different company. The readers need to know if the content publisher is making money by sharing a link or product.

In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site:

Any/all of the links on [](https://worthknow.com/)<https://worthknow.com/> are affiliate links for which I receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.

## **What Are Affiliate Links?**

Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites: when a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on https://worthknow.com/[](https://worthknow.com/) to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly (not from WorthKnow).

Amazon and/or other companies pay WorthKnow a small commission or other compensation for helping to bring customers to their website.

Prices are exactly the same for readers whether they purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. Clicking an affiliate link and clicking a non-affiliate link does not change the price or anything else for the visitor.

WorthKnow uses two main types of affiliate programs:

## **1. Amazon Affiliate links:**

<https://worthknow.com/> is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for website owners to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites, as well as to other websites that may be affiliated with Amazon Service LLC Associates Program.

## 2. Product Affiliate Links:

If you click a product affiliate link and buy the product, then I will get a percentage of the sale or some other type of compensation.

Again, prices are not different if you use these affiliate links. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link. These links are not “pay per click.”

## **What about Sponsored Content?**

I do not write sponsored posts. I want to provide authentic, un-biased information. However, if a company would like to publish sponsored content on WorthKnow, I will disclose this clearly in the beginning of the post.

The bottom line is that I only recommend products I use myself or that I would recommend to family and friends.

Your purchase helps support my research efforts. Thank you very, very much! I appreciate you
