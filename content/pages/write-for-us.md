This means having a good handle on grammar and style, as well as being able to do extensive research when necessary. We’re also interested in finding people who are creative and have fresh ideas, after all, one of the main reasons someone would come to our blog is to find content that they can’t find anywhere else.

## We don’t accept the vast majority of pitches we receive:

To give you an idea, out of every 200 pitches we receive, we only accept about 5. But don’t let that discourage you! If you have a great idea for a post, we want to hear it.

Here are a few tips to make your pitch stand out:

1. Keep it short and sweet.

The ideal pitch is around 100 words. Any longer and you’re likely to lose our attention.

Your first sentence should be your thesis statement the main idea of your post in one sentence. The rest of your pitch should be used to explain why this is a great idea for a post, and how you plan to support your thesis.

3. Be specific.

We’re more likely to accept a pitch that’s focused on one specific topic than a pitch that tries to cover too much ground.

4. Do your research.

Make sure you’ve read our blog and are familiar with the kind of content we publish. This will not only help you write a better pitch, but it will also increase your chances of getting published.

5. Have a catchy headline.
