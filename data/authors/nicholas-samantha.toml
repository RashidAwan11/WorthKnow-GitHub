bio = "Nicholas Samantha is the proud owner of worthknow. This website is dedicated to helping people learn about the net worth of different famous people. Nicholas started this website because he himself was curious about the net worth of his favorite celebrities.\n\nHe hopes that through this website, people will be able to learn more about their favorite celebrities and understand how they became so successful. I'm passionate about personal finance and helping others achieve their financial goals.\n\nI also believes that it is important for people to be aware of how much money different celebrities have so that they can get an idea about what is possible in life. Nicholas loves spending time with his family and friends, traveling, and learning new things.\n\nI served in the United States Marine Corps for six years and was a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After leaving the military, I worked in corporate America for a few years before starting my own business.\n\nWhen I'm not working on my website, you can find me playing basketball or spending time with my wife and two dogs."
